# CPU-scheduling-algorithms
The CPU Scheduling is the process by which a process is executed by the using the resources of the CPU. The process also can wait due to the absence or unavailability of the resources. These processes make the complete use of Central Processing Unit.CPU scheduling algorithms are used by operating systems to allocate CPU time to processes.<br>
<br> <b>Some common CPU scheduling algorithms are:</b><br>
* First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)<br>
* Shortest Job First (SJF)<br>
* Priority Scheduling<br>
* Round Robin (RR)<br>
* Multilevel Queue Scheduling<br>
## First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
First Come First Serve CPU Scheduling Algorithm, the CPU allots the resources to the process in a certain order. The order is serial way. The CPU is allotted to the process in which it has occurred.<br>
-First Serve CPU Scheduling Algorithm follows First In First Out in Ready Queue.
## Shortest Job First (SJF)
